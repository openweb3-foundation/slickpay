# SlickPay - Powering Cross-Chain Payment Solutions

SlickPay Network is a Decentralised Cross-Chain P2P Payment Protocol Built on the Setheum Blockchain.
It includes these protocols:
- Cross-Chain Bridge (Built with Sygma SDK)
- On-Chain Cross-Chain Wallet (One Native Account Abstraction Wallet for All Chains)
- P2P Exchange (Onchain, Cross-chain & Offchain)
- Cross-Chain Payments
- Fiat-Crypto Payments (Users can send crypto to a person and that person receives fiat and vice-versa - Powered by SetPay P2P)
- Fiat-Crypto Settlements (Merchants can get paid in Fiat and get settled in crypto)
- Decentralised Dispute Resolution Mechanism
- On-Chain Decentralised Governance
- Wallet Recovery (powered by Setheum's Account Recovery)
- Decentralised Identity System (Powered by Setheum's SeeID - can use username, and password for accounts)
- Gated Accounts (Users can choose to gate their accounts from receiving unwanted tokens - `accept()`/`reject()`)
- Red Packets
- Recurring Payments (Subscriptions)
- Refundable Payments
- Both EVM and WASM Smart Contracts Support
- SlickPay SDK (Developers can build custom gateways and DeFi Apps on SetPay)

## Clearly Experimental - Don't know if it will work (WIP - 1st of its kind)
